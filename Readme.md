# About
This is a template for node typescript restful APIs. 

# Database
Database utilizes postrges and Prisma as the ORM. This can be changed in the database src directory as I attempted to make it abstracted enough to keep Prisma functionality seperate.

# Architecture
Follows the service, controller, repository format to provide layered levels of data processing and accessibility.

# Future work
Adding the following features
- Authentication and middleware
- Unit testing
